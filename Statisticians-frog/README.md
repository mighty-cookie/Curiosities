A statistician's frog is trying to cross a pond across which runs a line of stones.
The frog is not fond of water and thus moves by jumping on the stones one by one.
It only knows how to jump forward, with each of the remaining stones and the far
end of the pond equally likely to be picked for the next jump. What is the expected
value of the number of jumps?
