A statistician's frog is trying to cross a pond across which runs a line of lily
pads. The frog is not fond of water and thus moves by jumping on the lily pads
one by one. It only knows how to jump forward, with each of the remaining lily
pads and the far end of the pond equally likely to be picked for the next jump.
What is the expected value of the number of jumps?
